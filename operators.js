//OPERATORS are special symbols or keywords in programming that tell the computer to perform specific actions on values or variables. 
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
//ARITHMETIC OPERATORS are used to perform mathematical calculations.
let sum = a + b; //addition
let difference = a - b; //subtraction
let product = a * b; //multiplication
let quotient = a / b; //division
let remainder = a % b; //modulus
let exponentiation = a ** b; //exponentiation

console.log(exponentiation);

//exercise, code that calculates the parameter and the area of a rectangle.
let length = 8;
let width = 3;
let perimeter = 2 * (length + width);
let area = length * width;

//ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS are used to assign and update values to variables.
let c = 15;
let d = 4;

c += 5; //equivalent to c = c + 5
c -= 3; //equivalent to c = c - 3
d *= 2; //equivalent to d = d * 2
d /= 4; //equivalent to d = d / 4

//exercise, Start with x = 100 and use assignment operators to reduce it step by step until it equals 1.
let x = 100;
x /= 2; // x = 50
 x *= 5; // x = -25
x += 26; // x = 1

//COMPARISON OPERATORS are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).
let e = 20;
let f = 30;

//LOGICAL OPERATORS are used to combine multiple boolean expressions and return a boolean result.

//UNARY OPERATORS are operators that operate on a single operand to produce a new value.

//BITWISE OPERATORS are used to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers.

//TERNARY OPERATOR is a shorthand way of writing shorthand conditional statements, an if-else statement.

//STRING OPERATORS are used to perform operations on string values.
