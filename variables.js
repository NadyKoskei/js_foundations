//VARIABLES are used to store data values that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.

let age; //declaration
age = 20; //assignment

const Name = "Nady"; //INITIALIZATION is declaration and assignment at the same time

console.log("i am " + age + " years old.");
//CONCATENATION is using the + operator to combine strings and variables together.

age = age + 10; //REASSIGNMENT is updating the variable age by adding 10 to its current value
console.log("in 10 years, I will be " + age + " years old");
